# Research Journal 

To keep track of what I'm working on from week-to-week, I'm going to note down what I worked on and keep a mind map outlining the various different research projects and where they belong. 

The mind map is located here: https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/phdmindmap2858/1674073107875?sender=u0ed9a991910a5a1c20197999&key=80c75591-f8d5-4d4c-980d-1ffb3fde9612

# Project ideas 

## Population Inference

- (SURF) Distinguishability of subpopulations (Simulating two subpopulations in m1,m2,z,S1,S2 space and see if you can really distinguish between these two distributions with N observations) 
- (SURF) Correlations in the population space (Look for different correlations between different parameters - when are they detectable etc)
- (Ongoing) Pystroke: coding up my pistroke calculation properly and using it to explore the spin parameter space further
- Simpson's paradox: When is a correlation not a correlation - correlation vs subpopulation


## Parameter estimation
- (SURF) Breaking multimodality with higher order modes (Studies of GW190521 and maybe GW190412 find multimodality in mass-ratio. Can you break this with HMs? What other things have this feature?)
- (SURF) Multimodality on the calculation of PE from non-Gaussian data (ties in with the multimodality in the PE from GW170817


## Calibration 
- (Ongoing) ZPK fitting for the calibration transfer functions (and maybe astrophysical implications) 
- Calibration + TGR - does calibration have any impact in the inference of TGR parameters? 

## TGR
- TGR + population: impact of restricting the population on TGR results.
