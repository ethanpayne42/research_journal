# Research Journal 

To keep track of what I'm working on from week-to-week, I'm going to note down what I worked on and keep a mind map outlining the various different research projects and where they belong. 

The mind map is located here: https://app.mural.co/invitation/mural/phdmindmap2858/1674073107875?sender=u0ed9a991910a5a1c20197999&key=80c75591-f8d5-4d4c-980d-1ffb3fde9612
